# Prodigy_Task5

🔻 What I worked on:
Analyzed accident trends based on weather and road conditions
Categorized accidents by time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night)
Identified accident hotspots across locations
Visualized contributing factors using charts for better insights

🔻 Tools Used:
 Python | Pandas | Matplotlib
 
📊 Key Insights:
Higher accident frequency during evening and night hours
Rainy weather and wet roads show increased accident risk
Certain locations emerged as accident hotspots
Severe accidents are more common under poor weather conditions
This task strengthened my skills in exploratory data analysis, pattern identification, and data visualization.
